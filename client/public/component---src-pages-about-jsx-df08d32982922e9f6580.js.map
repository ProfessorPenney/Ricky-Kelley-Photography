I am dedicated to helping you capture your most important\r\n            moments while delivering the most professional product I can. I specialize in\r\n            photojournalism which can be described as “capturing the uninterrupted moment.” This\r\n            style allows me to better emphasize the candid moments and emotions of your special\r\n            events. In a sense, I consider myself a photographic storyteller in the way I convey\r\n            whole experiences through images – and through these images, I present you your most\r\n            special experiences and memories in a way that you may cherish them forever.\r\n         </p>\r\n         <p className={aboutStyles.text}>\r\n            I favor using techniques and methods that lessen the need for unnatural manipulation of\r\n            the scene while finding more comfortable means so my clients are able to relax and be\r\n            themselves in front of my lens. I believe the comfort level that I have achieved with my\r\n            clients is completely evident in my past work. I do offer posed shots when it comes to\r\n            group and family portraits but whenever possible I prefer to focus on more natural shots\r\n            where the photographer is an unobtrusive figure. I offer photography services in such\r\n            fields as: Weddings, Headshots, Senior Portraits, Baby Portraits, Family Portraits, Pet\r\n            Portraits, Concerts/Shows, Prom/Homecoming, and Real Estate Photography.\r\n         </p>\r\n         <p className={aboutStyles.text}>I look forward to hearing from you!</p>\r\n         <p className={aboutStyles.text}>Ricky</p>\r\n      </div>\r\n   )\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default About\r\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
