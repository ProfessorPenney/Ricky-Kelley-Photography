I am dedicated to helping you capture your most important moments while delivering the most professional product I can. I specialize in photojournalism which can be described as “capturing the uninterrupted moment.” This style allows me to better emphasize the candid moments and emotions of your special events.

I believe the comfort level that I have achieved with my clients is completely evident in my past work. I do offer posed shots when it comes to group and family portraits but whenever possible I prefer to focus on more natural shots where the photographer is an unobtrusive figure. I offer photography services in such fields as: Weddings, Headshots, Senior Portraits, Baby Portraits, Family Portraits, Pet Portraits, Concerts/Shows, Prom/Homecoming, and Real Estate Photography."),a.createElement("p",{className:s},"I look forward to hearing from you!"),a.createElement("p",{className:s},"Ricky"))}}}]);
